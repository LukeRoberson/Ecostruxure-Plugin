# Definitions to parse alarm events from EcoStruxure webhooks
#
# Events are one of:
# - Activated: A new alarm has been activated.
# - Cleared: An existing alarm has been cleared.
#
# Definitions below contain:
# - description: A short description of the event. This is used for documentation purposes.
# - message: A message template that will be used to format the event message.
# - teams: Optional message template for Microsoft Teams notifications. If not provided, the other message will be used.
#
# Note: The activation label often contains spaces. To handle this, the parser will replace spaces with underscores in the event name.
#   The events below need to include underscores where spaces are present in the activation label.
